This example demonstrates how to write a type loader for Gosu, and use it from your own Gosu code.

You need to compile and package the Java code. Use Aardvark (http://vark.github.com), put it on
your PATH, and run the default target in build.vark.
    > vark build

You now have a file target/dynamictype.jar.  This jar has a special line in its MANIFEST.MF which
registers your type loader.

Run the .gsp
    > cd bin
    > gosu test-dynamic-type.gsp

Note the line at the top of the .gsp:
    #!/usr/bin/env gosu
If you're in a UNIX-type environment (e.g. Linux or OSX), you can directly execute the .gsp if
gosu is on your path:
    > cd bin
    > ./test-dynamic-type.gsp
